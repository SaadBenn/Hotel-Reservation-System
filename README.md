# Hotel-Reservation-System

The program reads in a file that contains customers' prefences for rooms and then the program looks 
through its database to find a matching room. If the customer requires consective rooms fo a particular type then the progtram will search for unallocated rooms. If there are any left then the program will reserve them otherwise look for other types of room.
